## 🧠 Why I Built This
Many colleges (including mine) don’t have an active tech/product culture.  
So I built **CampusBuddy AI** as a practical tool that helps students:
- save time,
- build better study habits,
- and stay exam-ready.

This project is also part of my journey of building real-world tools and sharing them publicly.
